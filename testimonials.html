                                    <p><a href="http://viadeo.com">Viadeo</a> is using Thumbor more and more. We used to
                                        have some home-made Java code to deliver images from http://www.viadeo.com. This
                                        code is still alive for some parts of our site.</p>
                                    <p>Since the end of summer 2013, Thumbor is a reality at Viadeo. First via IOS
                                        application for member's profile photos, then our news platform uses it for new
                                        parts of the site, taking more and more place and also some Android applications.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Thumbor helps us in migrating and decoupling applications from our storage backend.
                                        We were able to move from NFS (centralized and very sensitive to high loads) to a
                                        distributed storage like HBase, using a hbase storage plugin. Using the same
                                        technique of lazy loading (via Storage cache in thumbor) we can imagine changing our
                                        image's storage at our convenience should apache HBase start to show deficiencies.
                                        This is really comfortable for Ops.</p>

                                    around a billion images served per month.

                                    <p>We created thumbor because of our very large collection of images.</p>
                                    <p>Every time we introduced a new image size, a colossal effort followed to re-generated
                                        our images. Thumbor solved this and much more and it's a key strategic piece of our
                                        portal infrastructure now.</p>
                                    <p>Afterwards thumbor's filters added depth to the tools available to designers and
                                        mobile web developers.</p>
                                    <p>The extensible nature of thumbor's infrastructure also helps it adapt quite
                                        transparently to every environment we need it to.</p>
